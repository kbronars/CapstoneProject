Distance Runner Analysis Enabling Prediction of Runner Placement Finish
Problem Statement:
The world of competitive running has many participants all looking for a (legal) edge in order to ensure the best performance possible by a particular runner/participant. By understanding the predicted outcome for a runner and being able to layer on the predicted weather pattern, a runner could increase their likelihood of a higher placement by being able to counter act any factors that negatively affect their performance.

Client:
The proposed client is any sportswear outfitting company that sponsors long-distance runners. The desired result is to be able to better outfit runners to obtain their best placement level by counter acting some of the negative effects on their performance (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation, the list of runner competitors, etc.).

Data Sources:
Runner data will be garnered from Association of Road Racing Statisticians and 15 of the top current (past five years) marathon runners will be selected from both the men’s and the women’s division. Individual runner data will collected and analyze for this exercise and is available online at http://more.arrs.net/. For the purpose of this exercise, runners must classified as “road” participants which is any outdoor races or tracks greater than 440 yards. 

Weather data will be collected from Weather History Underground and it is available online at https://www.wunderground.com/. Weather data will be specific to the races selected for individual runner data collected. For the purpose of this exercise, only temperature, humidity (and/or heat index) and precipitation with be gathered for analysis. While wind may be a contributing factor in race performance (both speed and direction), the number of changes in course direction preclude this from being a factor that is easily analyzed at this time.

Lastly, individual course data will be collected from the race websites and will include information such as course length (specifically when races with a distance under a marathon are being analyzed), course elevation (in a general sense, not specific to any point in the race) and date and time for the start of the race.

Approach:
After the data is combine in a consistent format (which, due to the multitude of sources will take some time), individual runner data will be analyzed first using temperature and other variables to understand race place and how weather variables may affect a runner’s place. Additionally, race time will also be analyzed with the same filters. Various distances would be separate so that a runner profile could be created to understand what factors matter most for the various race distances (i.e., is temperature more important for a 10K, humidity more important for a Marathon, etc.).

Course elevation and race price money as well as competitors present at a race may additionally be utilized to determine what factors outside weather have an effect on runner performance.

Deliverables:
Deliverables will include the combined data set and code and a slide deck with analysis. Since individual runners are being examined, a profile for the top runners of each gender (at a minimum) will be compiled and created to understand how to maximize their performance for future races and what conditions need to be neutralized in order to ensure their best performance.
